/*
Number Analysis Program


Write a program that asks the user for a file name. Assume the file contains a series of
numbers, each written on a separate line. The program should read the contents of the
file into an array and then display the following data:
• The lowest number in the array
• The highest number in the array
• The total of the numbers in the array
• The average of the numbers in the array


The Student CD contains a text file named numbers.txt. that you can use to test the
program.
