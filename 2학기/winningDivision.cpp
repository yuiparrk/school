/*
Winning Division

Write a program that determines which of a company’s four divisions (Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, and Southwest) had the 
greatest sales for a quarter. It should include the following two functions, which are called by main.
• double getSales() is passed the name of a division. It asks the user for a division’s quarterly sales figure, validates the input,
 then returns it. It should be called once for each division.
• void findHighest() is passed the four sales totals. It determines which is the largest and prints the name of the high grossing 
division, along with its sales figure.

*Input Validation: Do not accept dollar amounts less than $0.00.
