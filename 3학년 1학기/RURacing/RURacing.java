 * RU Racing: The Algorithmic Grand Prix of Rutgers University
 * =========================================================
 * 
 * In the bustling campus of Rutgers University, a legendary competition has
 * emerged from the
 * intersection of computer science and classic racing: The Algorithmic Grand
 * Prix. This race
 * showcases the practical application of algorithmic complexity through a
 * thrilling competition
 * that pushes the boundaries of teleportation technology.
 * 
 * THE LORE:
 * ---------
 * In the year 2062, a historic collaboration between Rutgers' Computer Science
 * and Physics
 * departments led to a revolutionary breakthrough. Professor Sesh Venugopal
 * from CS and
 * Dr. Angela Merkel from Physics jointly published a paper on
 * "Quantum-Computational Teleportation
 * Matrices" that shattered previous limitations in quantum mechanics.
 * 
 * Their combined expertise produced the ScarletTeleporter™, harnessing quantum
 * entanglement
 * and computational topology to instantly move objects across space. The
 * prototype, built in
 * the underground labs beneath the Physics Building on Busch Campus, caused
 * quite a stir
 * when a freshman accidentally teleported an entire batch of Friday the 13th
 * dining hall
 * meatloaf into President Holloway's office.
 * 
 * Despite this mishap, the ScarletTeleporter™ revolutionized transportation at
 * Rutgers,
 * allowing students to teleport between campuses in the blink of an eye.
 * However, the
 * Physics department quickly identified a fundamental constraint: the quantum
 * particle
 * accelerator powering the device had significant energy requirements tied to
 * Heisenberg's
 * Uncertainty Principle. Different implementations had varying power
 * requirements and
 * capabilities based on their algorithmic approach to quantum field
 * stabilization.
 * 
 * Seeing an educational opportunity, the departments collaborated to create the
 * Algorithmic
 * Grand Prix - a race that would demonstrate not just teleportation technology,
 * but the
 * real-world impact of algorithmic efficiency on quantum physical systems.
 * 
 * THE RACERS:
 * -----------
 * 1. ScarletKnight (⚔): The traditional mascot of Rutgers, equipped with the
 * most basic
 * teleporter. This racer demonstrates O(N) linear time complexity, steadily
 * advancing one
 * step at a time without needing to charge. While consistent, this approach
 * lacks the
 * advantage of longer jumps.
 * 
 * 2. StarbucksTruck (🚚): Named after the popular coffee truck often found on
 * College Avenue,
 * this racer exemplifies O(N²) quadratic time complexity. The truck carries
 * enormous batteries
 * that take N turns to charge but only teleport one space at a time, making it
 * reliable but
 * inefficient for long races.
 * 
 * 3. LogNExpress (🚎): Named after the LX bus route that connects Livingston
 * and College Avenue,
 * this racer demonstrates O(log N) logarithmic time complexity. It can double
 * its teleportation
 * distance with each jump (1, 2, 4, 8...) without charging, allowing it to
 * cover ground
 * exponentially faster.
 * 
 * 4. NLogNExpress (🚌): Named after the most efficient sorting algorithms, this
 * racer combines
 * logarithmic jumps with linear charging time, demonstrating O(N log N)
 * complexity. It requires
 * N turns to charge between each jump, but its jump distance doubles each time.
 * 
 * THE RACE:
 * ---------
 * The race takes place on tracks that loop around Rutgers campuses. Each racer
 * must complete
 * exactly one lap, starting and finishing at the same point. Racers are ranked
 * based on:
 * 1. Fewest actions taken (fastest time)
 * 2. In case of a tie, greatest distance traveled
 * 
 * Each racer employs a different strategy based on algorithmic complexity
 * theories:
 * - O(N) linear: Move forward consistently one step per action
 * - O(N²) quadratic: Charge for N actions, then move one step
 * - O(log N) logarithmic: Double teleportation distance with each move action
 * - O(N log N): Charge for N actions, then double teleportation distance
 * 
 * Important rule: In each simulation step where a racer acts, it can perform
 * only ONE action - either charge
 * its battery OR teleport. This constraint creates the different time
 * complexity behaviors.
 * 
 * Will the slow-and-steady ScarletKnight prevail? Or will the logarithmic
 * efficiency of the
 * LogNExpress zoom to victory? The outcome depends on the length of the track
 * and the
 * implementation of each racing strategy.
 * 
 * Students must implement these strategies to understand how algorithmic
 * complexity affects
 * real-world performance!
